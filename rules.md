<b><u>RULES</u></b><br/>
A game starts with 4 players being dealt 13 cards each. The aim of the game is to get rid of all of your cards, at which point you will gain a number of points equal to the sum of the number of cards
that the other players are left with. Players who do not win will get minus the number of cards they have left. <br/><br/>
Whoever has the 3 of clubs goes first, and the first play must include the 3 of clubs (any valid hand type that contains it). The next player must play a higher hand of the same type or pass (single cards are ranked firstly by number and then by suit. 3 is the lowest, 2 the highest (3&lt;4&lt;5&lt;6&lt;7&lt;8&lt;9&lt;10&lt;J&lt;Q&lt;K&lt;A&lt;2) and suits are ranked: Clubs &lt; Diamonds &lt; Hearts &lt; Spades, so the 2 of spades is the highest card).
This continues until everyone passes or someone plays the 2 of spades, at which point that player then has control. When in control, a player may play any valid 1,2,3,4 or 5 card hand. Subsequent players must play a valid hand of the same number of cards which is higher than the previous hand played. 
This continues until everyone passes, at which point control is gained again and any valid hand may be played. <br/><br/>
Valid 2 card hands: pairs - ranked primarily by number (so 5 5 &lt; 10 10 regardless of suit), and then by suit (pair with highest suit wins, e.g. 10D 10S beats 10C 10H). Again 2 is highest.<br/>
Valid 3 card hands: none (three of a kind is not used).<br/>
Valid 4 card hands: none (two pair is not used).<br/>
Valid 5 card hands: Straight (5 numbers in a row). Wrap straights are allowed: A 2 3 4 5 is the lowest straight (tie-break by 5 suit), 2 3 4 5 6 is the highest straight (tie-break by 2 suit), and 10 J Q K A is the second highest (tie-break by A suit). Comparison of straights is based on this ordering, then by the highest card's suit within the straight. Full house (3 of one number, 2 of another, e.g. 3D 3S 6S 6H 6C). Comparisons based on higher 3 card section, e.g. 3S 3H 10H 10S 10C beats 2S 2H 4C 4H 4S. Four of a kind is a 5-card hand (four of the same number plus any kicker). Straight flush (both a straight and a flush - follows the same straight ordering and suit tie-break as straights). Straight &lt; Full House &lt; Four of a Kind &lt; Straight Flush<br/>
Special rules: A single 2 of spades cannot be beaten, so everyone else must pass and the player who played it regains control after the passes. Four of a kind can be played at any time regardless of the current hand, except when the current hand is a straight flush or a single 2 of spades. Straight flush can be played at any time regardless of the current hand, except when the current hand is a single 2 of spades.
